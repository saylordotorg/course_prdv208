**Unit 10: Consolidating the Tools of Information Management and
Processing** <span id="10"></span> 
*In the final unit of this course, you will further develop your
knowledge and skills by incorporating all four office suite tools to
create materials for the purpose of guiding a business decision. You
will examine how the integration of word-processing, presentation,
spreadsheet, and database features can be used to make an organization’s
informational and communication materials more effective. This unit will
demonstrate how the features and functions associated with all four
office suite tools may be integrated to address a business need such as
planning, executing, and reporting of a business project involving
customer satisfaction and responses. Career growth is important to you
and your next large assignment may be just around the corner. For
example, your boss may ask you to manage an event for the company, such
as an industry conference or any large off-site event that will include
both employees and clients. In this case, you will want to know how to
manage all of the information required for this event. This course will
show you how to structure your information across all of the tools that
will maximize use and consistency to make this event a success. You will
learn how to pull precise information from one tool and insert it into
another. You will learn how to update information in one tool and have
the information automatically update across all other tools. Using our
example about organizing an event, you will learn how to track the
activities of the event and participants and provide valuable
information to your boss both during and after the event. All of these
new skills will make you a very knowledgeable and valuable employee.*

**10.1 Why Is Tool Integration Important for Creating Documents to Aid
Business Decisions?** <span id="10.1"></span> 
*There is no better example to illustrate the importance of tool
integration for creating a document to aid business decisions than an
annual corporate report. These documents represent both the forward
strategic direction of the corporation as well as the past
performance. The objective is to use words, charts, graphs, and tables
to explain past and future activities of the business. To see how
effective these documents use these tools, follow the link below to view
some recently published annual reports.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and study the five
    annual reports on the webpage. Click on each company name on the
    main page, and then select the link to the PDF of the report. You
    will notice that each document uses a variety of components, such as
    a combination of words, charts, graphs, and tables, to explain
    various business conditions. You may click on the right or left
    arrow on the Annual Reports homepage to view additional annual
    reports, or use the tabs at the bottom of the page to select an

    you do not live in the United States, you may still complete the
    activity by supplementing the information of US Senators and
    Representatives with your own government officials.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 2 hours.

**10.3 The Integration of Word Processing with Presentation,
Spreadsheet, and Database Content** <span id="10.3"></span> 
*In most cases, word processing and presentation documents are the
integration points for business data and information. Information in the
form of charts, graphs, and tables can be integrated into a word
processing document in order to deliver a more impactful message.  An
example is how the US Department of Treasury is using this technique to
tell the story of the [“TARP: Bank Investment
Program”](http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/bank-investment-programs/Pages/default.aspx). 
These same business artifacts can be inserted into a presentation or
uploaded to a website. In order to become effective at integrating these
various forms of information, a business analyst must become familiar
with how other similar organizations are using these integrated tools. A
good practice is to review websites, brochures, and other published
documents to stay current on best practices in your industry.  
  
 To facilitate your continuous learning, please review the US Government
Publication website to see how various state and federal agencies are
creating publications by integrating information.*
