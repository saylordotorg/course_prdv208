**Unit 7: Integrating Spreadsheet Information and Processing with
Word-Processing and Presentation Documents** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine how to integrate word-processing
documents and spreadsheets in order to make an organization’s
informational and communications materials, such as with a proposal or
planning document that requires graphics and data inserted within the
textual message, more effective. Then, you will examine some of the
common tool features that typically are integrated in a business
environment. You will conclude this unit by studying how the integration
of word-processing documents and spreadsheets can be useful in guiding
business decisions and addressing organizational requirements and client
needs. As you advance in your career, your boss may request you to
create an annual report that provides details of the work accomplished
for the year along with an executive summary that gives a high level
review of these accomplishments. Having the knowledge and skills to
achieve these results can be critical to your career, and this unit will
show you how to integrate all of the spreadsheet features into a word or
presentation document that will demonstrate your value to the
organization.*

**7.2 Why Spreadsheet Integration Is Important for Business Decisions**
<span id="7.2"></span> 
*The consolidation and presentation of data is very valuable in making a
business decision. Often organizations will use a variety of tools and
formats to evaluate business information. These collected artifacts need
to be consolidated in a representative fashion that will tell the
complete business story. Data/information integration is the process
used to achieve this goal. You will complete an activity at the end of
the unit that asks you to share your ideas about why spreadsheet
integration is important by posting to the course discussion board. Take
approximately 15 minutes to outline some ideas about why you think this
type of integration is important.*
