**Unit 2: Information Management Tools and Business Requirements** <span
id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine how information management tools are
applied to business requirements, which are a broad range of components
(e.g. Human Resources, sales, marketing, product development, etc.) used
to effectively run an organization and to eliminate any potential
issues; you will learn more about this topic in sub-subunit 2.1.2.
Information management tools exist to drive the value of an organization
by supporting organizational needs, objectives, and strategies.   
    
 More specifically, you will learn how to develop memos, graphs, and
reports to support customer communications and interactions. You will
focus on the application of the standard office suite tools that are
used by most organizations and businesses to address business needs for
planning and operations. You will learn about the key features of each
tool and examine how these tools may be used to deliver valuable
information to a business or organization such as writing memos, using
building presentations, sales forecasts, and fund-raising projections.
For example, you may be asked by your boss to write a memo to a client
or to create a presentation describing a new service your organization
is about to offer. In these cases, you would need to know how to use
information management tools. This unit will show you how an
organization would apply information management tools to achieve the
desired results. You will also learn how the use of these tools can
overlap. For example, after completing the memo and presentation task,
your boss may then ask you to develop a spreadsheet that tracks the
responses or even collect the responses in a database and produce weekly
or monthly reports. This unit will also give you an overview of
information management tools and how these tools are applied to business
requirements.*

evolving role that grows and shrinks with the advancement of technology
and organizational process maturity.*

**2.1.3 Determining Which Tool to Use** <span id="2.1.3"></span> 
*The secret to determining which tool to use is that there is no
secret*.*This process should be based on the culture of the organization
or target audience. Many organizations openly embrace presentations,
while others prefer a detailed word document with graphs and charts. The
key is to ask the customer or make an open suggestion and ask for
feedback. Some professional presenters will use multiple tools
(presentations, fact sheets, flyers, etc.) to deliver their message. As
a business analyst, you should communicate with your boss and target
audience to determine their preferences.*

**2.1.4 How to Design a Solution for a Business Need** <span
id="2.1.4"></span> 
**2.1.4.1 Templates** <span id="2.1.4.1"></span> 
*Do not reinvent the wheel. One of the advantages of an office suite and
access to the Internet is the availability of templates. Templates are
available to solve almost any communications challenge and with only
minor adjustments, a standard template can be transformed into a custom
document. The first step for any information management and processing
assignment should be centered on identifying a public domain (freeware)
template or an existing organizational template. Once a great document
has been created, you should consider converting the structure of the
document into a reusable template for the organization.*

**2.1.4.2 Business Processes** <span id="2.1.4.2"></span> 
*As defined by Laudon & Laudon,* business processes*are the unique ways
in which organizations coordinate and organize work activities,
information, and knowledge to produce a product or
service.<sup>1</sup> This definition or some derivative of it is used as
the standard to describe business processes and information technology
processes which are applied in a business environment.  In both
industries, business processes refers to the unique manner in which work
is organized, coordinated, and focused to produce a valuable product or
service.*

**2.1.4.3 Business Standards** <span id="2.1.4.3"></span> 
*Business standards are processes that are used to facilitate a constant
business practice. The purpose of implementing business standards is to
ensure the success of the targeted goal. Organizations develop or
implement business standards to compete effectively or develop a
strategic advantage. Without effective business standards, organizations
may find themselves at a disadvantage. The office suite that we are
using in this course represents business standards. These standards
allow organizations to share data information, which results in the
ability to use standard business processes.*

**2.2.1.1 Validating Information and Data** <span id="2.2.1.1"></span> 
*One of the major challenges when retrieving information or data from an
Internet source is the accuracy of the information/data. To address this
challenge, we suggest that you find a second web source that confirms
the information/data and list the source of the information/data within
your document. This action will serve two purposes:*  
  
 *1) it will allow others to validate your source of the information,
and 2) it will allow you to explain any challenges to the
information/data.*

**2.2.1.2 The Role of the Business Owner or Client in Validating Data**
<span id="2.2.1.2"></span> 
*As a business analyst, it is important that you obtain reliable
information from the business owner or client. When preparing a report
or presentation that represents data from a business owner/client, you
should ask for the original source of the data and the date that the
information was created. This information should be included as a
footnote or reference.*

**2.2.2 How Should Information Be Secured?** <span id="2.2.2"></span> 
*Securing information is a major issue in most business environments. It
is possible that you are working on a document that has sensitive data
about the organization that can have an impact on the public or your
organization. Some believe that if the document is on one’s own computer
or stored on a computer server, then it is safe. In reality, this just
means that it is difficult to acquire access to the data, but it is not
safe. One of the best practices for protecting a file or information is
to password-protect the information.*

**2.2.2.2 Securing Public Data and Information** <span
id="2.2.2.2"></span> 
*Although some people may think that protecting public data and
information is not important, in many cases the data/information we
obtain from a meeting, Internet source, or a presentation given by a
vendor may be sensitive. When using pubic data/information, you should
document the sources and ask the source provider if the information can
be republished. This process will protect both you (your organization)
and the provider of the information. In addition, it will provide
disclosure of how the information was obtained.*
