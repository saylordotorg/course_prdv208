**Unit 4: Presentation Tools** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will gain an overview of the basic functions of
presentation tools and how they are used in a business environment. You
will study advanced presentation functions (e.g. templates, pictures and
objects, and layout and color schemes) that you can apply to address
business requirements. You will conclude this unit by studying how to
create an effective story or message for a business by using a common
set of presentation tools. For example, you may have been asked to
create a 15-minute sales presentation to a prospective client or to give
an organizational overview for new employees. Or, perhaps you are asked
to describe a problem to your boss and present a set of alternatives in
a meeting. In all of these situations, you will need to know how to
effectively use presentation tools. This unit will show you how to
effectively use these tools to enhance your presentation.*
