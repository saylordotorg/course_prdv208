**Unit 6: Spreadsheet Tools and Techniques** <span id="6"></span> 
*This unit will provide you with an overview of the basic features of
the spreadsheet tool and introduces you to advanced spreadsheet features
that you can apply to address business requirements. These advanced
features include formulas, functions, templates, and charts. You will
conclude this unit by examining how to create datasets and tables that
can be used to perform advanced data and information analyses. Such
analyses often help guide decision-making and achieve organizational and
client needs in a business environment. Organizations are always
creating new charts, graphs, reports, etc. to collect and show financial
information.  For example, your boss may ask you to create an expense
report that will be used to track employees’ costs for travel. This
course will provide you with some other great examples of when you might
need to use spreadsheet tools. If your boss came back a year later and
asked you to consolidate all of the previous expense reports and show
how the funds were spent based on certain categories (food, mileage,
hotel, travel, etc.), then you would want to make this process
efficient. This course will show you how to construct a standalone
report and use that electronic data to feed future request for data or
reports.*
