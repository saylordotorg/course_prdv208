The management and processing of information is an essential practice in
a business environment. All organizations ranging from social groups,
small businesses, non-profits, and large corporations have a need for
information to be analyzed and processed. These organizations require
that business analysts or other key employees demonstrate a mastery of
information management and processing in order to address critical
business problems such as business planning, inventory management, and
organizational forecast planning. In particular, these skills are needed
to perform data and information analyses and present the findings of
such analyses to help guide business-related decisions. This course will
provide you with a structured introduction to the key tools and
techniques used in information management and processing. If you have
ever been asked to organize information, analyze data, or create a
presentation to help your organization make a business-related decision,
then this course will help you develop or improve these essential
skills. This course will also provide you with an understanding of
practical approaches and techniques, such as integrating content from
various sources and constructing graphs to show data relationships that
are often used to process and present information in business
decision-making. You will use the standard office suite tools that most
companies use. You will learn how to select the best tool to address
your specific business need and how to integrate content produced from
the other tools. At the conclusion of the course, you will have mastered
the processes of integrating data using the standard information
management and processing tools and techniques.

### Course Information

Welcome to PRDV208. General information on the course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials including several YouTube videos and readings. However,
the course makes primary use of the following materials:  

-   The Open University’s *An Introduction to Data and
    Information*: [“Section 3.3: Data and
    Information”](http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=397573&section=3.3) and
    [“Section 3.4 What Has Any of This to Do with
    Computers?”](http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=397573&section=3.4)
-   The Open University’s *Storing and Processing Information*: [“The
    Technological Components of an Information
    System”](http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=405234&section=1)
-   The Open University’s *Finding Information in Business and
    Management*: [“Evaluating Business and Management Information on the
    Internet”](http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=397349&section=4.1) and
    [“Organizing Your
    Information”](http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=397349&section=5.1)
-   LibreOffice’s [Features](http://www.libreoffice.org/features/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units. You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
study all of the resources and complete the activities found in some of
the readings.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **30
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself. Each
unit should take approximately 3 hours to complete. Perhaps you can
dedicate completing Units 1-3 (a total of 9 hours) one week; Units 4-6
(a total of 9 hours) the next week; and so forth.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** It will be helpful to have an office suite with
word-processing, spreadsheet, database software, and presentation
software. You may currently have Microsoft Office or another office
suite. You may also download LibreOffice, which is explored in this
course, by following the instructions to download the free software
[here](http://www.libreoffice.org/download/).
