**Unit 5: Integration of the Word-Processing and Presentation Tools and
Techniques** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine how the integration of word-processing
and presentation tools can be used to make an organization’s
informational and communications materials, such as marketing and
promotional material, more effective. When you look at a brochure, have
you ever wondered why you seem to recognize some of the content, or when
you read an interesting article, you seem to recognize some of the words
or charts used in the article? This is largely because businesses reuse
information from other sources. Material used in a marketing campaign
may start out as a new business development report. The content from
this report can be reconfigured to create brochures, flyers, billboards,
or even web content. This course will show you how to integrate
word-processing and presentation tool techniques to produce business
products with a variety of usages. You will learn about some common
integration features of the word-processing and presentation tools and
demonstrate how these tools can be integrated. This unit will conclude
by showing you how specific presentation-tool features may be integrated
into a word-processing document and how specific word-processing
features may be integrated into a presentation.*

**5.2 Why Is Integration of Word-Processing and Presentation Tools
Important for Making Business Decisions?** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*The consolidation and presentation of data is very valuable in making a
business decision. Often organizations will use a variety of tools and
formats to evaluate business information. These collected artifacts need
to be consolidated in a representative fashion that will tell the
complete business story. Data/Information integration is the process
used to achieve this goal. In the Unit 5 activity, you will post your
own ideas about why the integration of word-processing and presentation
tools is important to the course discussion board. Take approximately 15
minutes to outline some ideas about why you think this type of
integration is important.*
