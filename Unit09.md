**Unit 9: Database and Spreadsheet Integration** <span id="9"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine how the integration of database
information and spreadsheets may be used to make an organization’s
informational and communications materials more effective. This unit
will start with an examination of some of the common features of the
database and spreadsheet tools, and it will then go on to demonstrate
how these features may be integrated to perform data analysis reports
such as sales forecasts, product cost models, or fund raising
projection. Data contained in a database sometimes need to be released
into a form that allows greater flexibility and manipulation. Business
organizations are often involved in* what-if-analysis *to understand the
impact on past and future business actions. Your boss may ask you to
retrieve all of the customer information for a certain spending level
and do an analysis of how discounts impact their spending habits or
perform an analysis on the seasonal spending habits.*  
  
 *This unit will show you how to combine both the database tool and the
spreadsheet tool to produce useful analysis for your organization. You
will conclude this unit with an examination of the key features and
functions associated with the integration of database-tool information
and spreadsheet documents, and how these features may aid
decision-making in a business environment.*

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   identify the tool functions that allow for integration and content
    sharing across the database and spreadsheet tools;
-   describe how to design a database report using integrated
    spreadsheet data, as well as perform this task;
-   describe how to design a spreadsheet document using integrated data
    from retrieved database tables, as well as perform this task;
-   explain how database content can be integrated into a spreadsheet
    document.
-   identify key features for sharing content; and
-   explain how spreadsheet tool content can be integrated into a
    database table or report.

**9.1 The Integration of Database Information and the Spreadsheet Tool**
<span id="9.1"></span> 
*Take approximately 15 minutes to study the information provided in
subunits 9.1 and 9.2. The similarities between data contained in a
database and a spreadsheet are great. These similarities often lead
businesses to the conclusion that a spreadsheet can address most
business needs. Although this is true in many cases, the best practice
for handling transactional data is to use a database. This transactional
data can be used to generate reports by using the database tool or by
extracting the data into another form (spreadsheet) for reporting. One
of the chief benefits of this practice is to allow other users to have
access to the data without relinquishing control. The extracted data can
be configured to update automatically from the database if needed or
just used as a snap shot in time data set.*

**9.2 Why Integration Is Important for Business Decisions** <span
id="9.2"></span> 
*Integration of data from a database to a spreadsheet, or the reverse,
is an important feature of data analysis that can assist the
organization in making or evaluating business decisions. An organization
that wishes to evaluate recent trends in the business transactions can
extract data from a database to a spreadsheet and manipulate the data as
part of the evaluation process. This extracted data can give the
business analyst an opportunity to evaluate the effect that certain
conditions have on the transactions and the resulting impacts.
Organizations can also create data in a spreadsheet tool and integrate
this data into the database to evaluate the potential results or to
update the database with transactions that were executed outside of the
database environment. Having the ability to move data between these two
tools provides a business analyst with the capability and flexibility to
evaluate data in multiple operational modes.*

**9.3 The Key Features for Sharing Content across the Database and
Spreadsheet Tools** <span id="9.3"></span> 
**9.3.1 The Database Tool** <span id="9.3.1"></span> 
*Take approximately 30 minutes to review the following information and
practice the steps.* *The question many database users ask is “how do I
convert database information into a spreadsheet?” To complete this
process, you export the data from a database structure to a spreadsheet.
One reason that many users want to do this function is to have the
ability to distribute the data to someone else who may not have access
to the database tool. As a system owner or steward of the data, you may
also feel more comfortable* *sending someone a simple spreadsheet
containing exactly the data that person requires rather than to send the
person the whole database and then say, “run the individual query.”*  
  
 *In any case, it is very easy to export data from a database to a
spreadsheet. You can either export the contents of a table, or the
result of a query.* *Here is how you go about doing this.*  
  
 *Click on the table or query that contains the data you want to
export.*  
 *From the “File” menu, click “Save As/Export.”*  
 *Select “To an External File or Database.”*  
 *Choose a location for your spreadsheet (or double click on an existing
one).*  
  
 *You now have a spreadsheet containing the data from your query that
you can email to anyone you like. Sub-subunit 9.5.1 will provide more
detailed steps to achieve this goal. *

**9.3.2 The Spreadsheet Tool** <span id="9.3.2"></span> 
*Take approximately 30 minutes to review the following information and
practice the steps.* *Many business analysts are more comfortable using
a spreadsheet tool to create and manipulate data and will use this tool
to prepare data that will be later loaded into a database. Users who
select this option should be aware of a few steps that are required to
ensure that the process is executed smoothly.* *Here is how you go about
doing this.*  
  
 *Create a new, empty database.*  
 *Prepare data for import.*  
 *Import the data.*  
 *Specify where you want to store the data.*  
  
 *You now have a database file containing the data from your spreadsheet
file. Sub-subunit 9.4.1 will provide more detailed steps to achieve this
goal.*

**9.5.2 How to Create a Spreadsheet Business Form with Integrated
Database Data** <span id="9.5.2"></span> 
-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Unit 9 Example”**
    Instructions: Once data is in an excel spreadsheet form, it can be
    manipulated into any of the standard functions of a spreadsheet. To
    demonstrate this feature, we are going to create a spreadsheet
    business form using the integrated database data. We will use the
    same process as outline in sub-subunit 6.5.1.  
      
     To demonstrate this feature, perform the following steps.  
      
     Enter the data in [this
    table](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Unit9Example.png)
    (PNG) into a database.  
     Export the table by using the process described in the sub-subunit
    9.5.1 video. Select the data and create a pie chart. Save the
    exported data and pie chart file as “Unit9Example.”  
     Using the information in the “Unit9Example” file, create a balance
    sheet for the members of an investment club called “Top Notch
    Investments.”  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.
