**Unit 1: Introduction to Information Management and Processing** <span
id="1"></span> 
*The first unit of this course introduces you to the concept of
information management and processing and gives you an idea of the
techniques that are typically used for analysis and decision-making in a
business environment. In this unit, you will learn how information
management and processing drives the selection of particular tools used
to solve business problems such as effective communication, business and
financial planning, and business analysis and reporting. Have you ever
wondered or been asked to explain information as it is related to
business? Or, have you ever been asked to identify the difference
between data and information? This course will provide you with the
answers to such questions that you may use in real-life situations. For
example, during an interview you may be asked about the office suite of
tools used by your previous organization. Instead of just saying we used
brand X, you can talk about specific products that are common across all
office suite tools. In the same interview, you will be able to explain
how these tools can be used effectively in any business environment and
perhaps give an example of how you would use the tools for this new
position. The tools used in this course are the standard office suite
tools (Microsoft Office Suite or compatible suites) that most companies
use.*
