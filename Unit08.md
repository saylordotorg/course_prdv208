**Unit 8: Database Management, Processing, and Techniques** <span
id="8"></span> 
*This unit will provide you with an overview of database management and
how you can use database information retrieval in a business environment
to manage inventories, customer information, and sales. This unit will
also introduce you to the various types of databases (hierarchical,
network, rational, and object-oriented) used in business environments
and will provide you with an understanding of how databases may be
structured to allow for information retrieval and the generation of
reports. You will conclude this unit by examining how information can be
acquired from a database and how such retrieval may help to guide
business decisions. Have you ever wondered why businesses seem to know
so much about you and your activities and can provide you with
validation information that you may struggle to remember?  Businesses
structure information in a manner that allows quick retrieval and
consolidation. This unit will show you how to manage your business data
and information so that when your boss asks you for a list of the
organization’s biggest donors or clients in a certain region of the
country, you can easily retrieve the data.*

*Information for business decisions can be a very valuable commodity.
There are many businesses that collect and sell data to organizations
based on the type and quantity of data needed. Before considering the
purchase of data, a business analyst should consider data that is in the
public domain. The US Census collects a great deal of data on the US
population that can be used to assist in business decisions.*
